NOAA is a critical tax-funded federal agency whose data collection, modeling and science capabilities, and personnel expertise keep the country safer and more prosperous---all at a cost of 6&cent; per day per taxpayer. If you are visiting this page and reading this, you have an interest in NOAA's science, service, and stewardship to the nation. **Contact your representatives in Congress today** to demand that NOAA employees are restored, facilities and resources are maintained, and budget is preserved."
