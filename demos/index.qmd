The products on this page rely on data from the [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration](https://www.noaa.gov) (NOAA). NOAA is a critical tax-funded federal agency whose data collection, modeling and science capabilities, and personnel expertise keep the country safer and more prosperous---all at a cost of 6&cent; per day per taxpayer. If you are visiting this page and reading this, you have an interest in NOAA's science, service, and stewardship to the nation. **Contact your representatives in Congress today** to demand that NOAA employees are restored, facilities are maintained, and budget is preserved.

3. [Plot and display the results](../demos/NOAA-CO-OPS-plots.ipynb)
