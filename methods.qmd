title: How are these records calculated?

All data from the beginning of each time series to the present are retrieved from the NOAA CO-OPS [Tides and Currents](https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/faq.html) data portal and saved to file to avoid having to repeatedly re-download the historical data. Subsequent data updates retrieve from the most recently saved timestamp onward and append these new data to the saved historical record.

Six-minute data are used whenever possible and hourly data otherwise.

Any observations flagged by NOAA as being suspect for any reason (flag > 0) are discarded. Examples of flagged data are a minimum or maximum value or a rate of change exceeding an acceptable tolerance. A day is allowed to have up to three hours of missing data to be counted in the daily climatologies, and a month is allowed up to two days of missing data to be counted in the monthly climatologies.

All of the statistics and records herein start with one of three quantities: daily highs, daily lows, or daily averages. Each of these is first calculated for each environmental variable (*i.e.*, air temperature, water temperature, water level) and for every day in the data time series as follows. 

### Daily High

This is the **maximum temperature recorded on any given day**. Let $X$ be a 24-hr time series of some environmental variable (*e.g.*, air temperature) sampled $n$ times during the day:

$$X = \{x_1, x_2,...,x_n\}$$

The daily high is the maximum value in this observation set:

$$\text{daily high} = \max(X)$$ {#eq-dh}

### Daily Low

Similarly, the daily low is the **minimum temperature recorded on any given day**:

$$\text{daily low} = \min(X)$$ {#eq-dl}

### Daily Average

The daily average is the **average of all recorded observations of a given variable on any given day**. It can be calculated in one of two ways:

#### Method 1: True average

This is the conventional method of calculating an average where one sums up all observations during the 24-hour period and divides by the number of observations, $n$:

$$\text{true daily average} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n x_i$$ {#eq-tda}

#### Method 2: Meteorological average

The meteorological average is customarily calculated using only the maximum and minimum values recorded during a 24-hour period:

$$\text{meteorological daily average} = \frac{\max(X) + \min(X)}{2}$$ {#eq-mda}

This project uses the true average (@eq-tda) for all calculations.

Daily statistics are calculated next, followed by monthly statistics.

## Daily Climatologies

Daily climatologies are calculated for each day-of-year (DOY), where

> Jan 1 $\longrightarrow$ Day 1  
Jan 2 $\longrightarrow$ Day 2  
...  
Feb 28 $\longrightarrow$ Day 59  
Feb 29 $\longrightarrow$ Day 60  
...  
Dec 30 $\longrightarrow$ Day 365  
Dec 31 $\longrightarrow$ Day 366

Instead of eliminating February 29 on leap years, Day 60 simply skipped in years that are *not* leap years. Thus, December 31 is always Day 366. Days start at midnight (00:00) and go until 23:59 (11:59 PM) local time.

### DOY Daily Average

The DOY daily average is the **average of all daily averages for any given DOY**. It is calculated by taking the daily averages calculated using @eq-tda, grouping them by DOY, and calculating the average for each DOY.

Let $\textbf{A}$ be a matrix of daily averages from @eq-tda arranged with years in rows and DOY in columns, and for simplicity, let subscript $y$ indicate year and $d$ indicate DOY:

$$\textbf{A} = (a_{yd}) = \left( \begin{array}{cccc}
a_{1,1} & a_{1,2} & ... & a_{1,d} \\
a_{2,1} & a_{2,2} & ... & a_{2,d} \\
\vdotswithin{=} & \vdotswithin{=} &  & \vdotswithin{=} \\
a_{y,1} & a_{y,2} & ... & a_{y,d} \end{array} \right)$$ {#eq-avgs-d}

The DOY daily average is the average over each column:

$$\text{DOY daily average} = \frac{1}{Y}\sum_{y=1}^Y a_{yd}$$ {#eq-ddy-d}

where $Y$ is the number of years in the observational time series.

Note: The Daily Average reported in the statistics dashboard are DOY daily averages from @eq-ddy-d.

### Record High Daily Average

The record high daily average is the **maximum daily average for any given DOY**. It is determined by taking the daily averages calculated using @eq-tda, grouping them by DOY, and finding the maximum value for each DOY. Given $\textbf{A}$ from @eq-avgs-d above:

$$\text{record high daily average} = {\max}_d |a_{yd}| = \max\{|a_{yd}|: d=1,2,...,366\}$$ {#eq-rhda-d}

### Record Low Daily Average

The record low daily average is the **minimum daily average for any given DOY**. It is determined by taking the daily averages calculated using @eq-tda, grouping them by DOY, and finding the minimum value for each DOY. Given $\textbf{A}$ from @eq-avgs-d above:

$$\text{record low daily average} = {\min}_d |a_{yd}| = \min\{|a_{yd}|: d=1,2,...,366\}$$ {#eq-rlda-d}

### Average High

The average high is the **average of all daily highs for any given DOY**. It is determined by taking the daily highs calculated using @eq-dh, grouping them by DOY, and calculating the average for each DOY.

Let $\textbf{H}$ be a matrix of daily highs from @eq-dh arranged with years in rows and DOY in columns, and for simplicity, let subscript $y$ indicate year and $d$ indicate DOY:

$$\textbf{H} = (h_{yd}) = \left( \begin{array}{cccc}
h_{1,1} & h_{1,2} & ... & h_{1,d} \\
h_{2,1} & h_{2,2} & ... & h_{2,d} \\
\vdotswithin{=} & \vdotswithin{=} &  & \vdotswithin{=} \\
h_{y,1} & h_{y,2} & ... & h_{y,d} \end{array} \right)$$ {#eq-highs-d}

The average high is the average over each column:

$$\text{average high} = \frac{1}{Y}\sum_{y=1}^Y h_{yd}$$ {#eq-ah-d}

where $Y$ is the number of years in the observational time series.

### Record High

The record high is the **maximum daily high for any given DOY**. It is determined by taking the daily highs calculated using @eq-dh, grouping them by DOY, and finding the maximum value for each DOY. Given $\textbf{H}$ from @eq-highs-d above:

### Lowest High

The lowest high is the **minimum daily high for any given DOY**. It is determined by taking the daily highs calculated using @eq-dh, grouping them by DOY, and finding the minimum value for each DOY. Given $\textbf{H}$ from @eq-highs-d above:

$$\text{lowest high} = {\min}_d |h_{yd}| = \min\{|h_{yd}|: d=1,2,...,366\}$$ {#eq-lh-d}

### Average Low

The average low is the **average of all daily lows for any given DOY**. It is determined by taking the daily lows calculated using @eq-dl, grouping them by DOY, and calculating the average for each DOY.

Let $\textbf{L}$ be a matrix of daily lows from @eq-dl arranged with years in rows and DOY in columns, and for simplicity, let subscript $y$ indicate year and $d$ indicate DOY:

$$\textbf{L} = (l_{yd}) = \left( \begin{array}{cccc}
l_{1,1} & l_{1,2} & ... & l_{1,d} \\
l_{2,1} & l_{2,2} & ... & l_{2,d} \\
\vdotswithin{=} & \vdotswithin{=} &  & \vdotswithin{=} \\
l_{y,1} & l_{y,2} & ... & l_{y,d} \end{array} \right)$$ {#eq-lows-d}

The average low is the average over each column:

$$\text{average low} = \frac{1}{Y}\sum_{y=1}^Y l_{yd}$$ {#eq-al-d}

where $Y$ is the number of years in the observational time series.

### Highest Low

The highest low is the **maximum daily low for any given DOY**. It is determined by taking the daily lows calculated using @eq-dl, grouping them by DOY, and finding the maximum value for each DOY. Given $\textbf{L}$ from @eq-lows-d above:

$$\text{highest low} = {\max}_d |l_{yd}| = \max\{|l_{yd}|: d=1,2,...,366\}$$ {#eq-hl-d}

### Record Low

The record low is the **minimum daily low for any given DOY**. It is determined by taking the daily lows calculated using @eq-dl, grouping them by DOY, and finding the minimum value for each DOY. Given $\textbf{L}$ from @eq-lows-d above:

$$\text{record low} = {\min}_d |l_{yd}| = \min\{|l_{yd}|: d=1,2,...,366\}$$ {#eq-rl-d}

### Number of Years in Record

The number of years of data available varies from day to day and between variables due to sensor availability, gaps in the observational record, or bad data being filtered out. Years are tallied by grouping the entire time series by DOY and counting the number of years for each day. For example, given $\textbf{A}$ from @eq-avgs-d above, the number of years is the total number of unique years in each column.


## Monthly Climatologies

Monthly climatologies are calculated in the same way as daily climatologies except daily highs, lows, and averages are grouped by calendar month instead of DOY.

### Monthly Average

a_{1,1} & a_{1,2} & ... & a_{1,12} \\
a_{2,1} & a_{2,2} & ... & a_{2,12} \\
