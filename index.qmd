The products on this page rely on data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). NOAA is a critical tax-funded federal agency whose data collection, modeling capabilities, and personnel expertise keep the country safer and more prosperous -- all at a cost of 6&#x00A2 per day per taxpayer. If you are visiting this page and reading this, you have an interest in NOAA's service to the nation. **Contact your representatives in Congress today** to demand that NOAA employees are restored, facilities are maintained, and budget is preserved.
