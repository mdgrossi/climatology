The products on this page rely on data from the [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration](https://www.noaa.gov) (NOAA). NOAA is a critical tax-funded federal agency whose mission is to provide science, service, and stewardship to the nation and whose data collection, modeling capabilities, and personnel expertise keep the country safer and more prosperous---all at a cost of 6&cent; per day per taxpayer. If you are visiting this page and reading this, you have an interest in NOAA's service to the nation. **Contact your representatives in Congress today** to demand that NOAA employees are restored, facilities and resources are maintained, and mission and budget are preserved.
