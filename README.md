# Local Climatology

This project creates [climatology dashboards](https://mdgrossi.github.io/climatology) for a number of locations along the east coast to which I have some degree of connection:

- Beaufort, North Carolina
- Woods Hole, Massachusetts
- Naples, Florida
- Bay St. Louis, Mississippi
- Virginia Key, Florida
- Lewes, Delaware

 Some are updated more regularly than others. More information about the [data](https://mdgrossi.github.io/climatology/data.html) and [methodology](https://mdgrossi.github.io/climatology/methods.html) are available on the website.

This project is inspired by [Brian McNoldy](https://bmcnoldy.earth.miami.edu) at the [University of Miami](https://welcome.miami.edu), whose long-standing ["Climatology of Virginia Key, FL" site](https://mcnoldy.earth.miami.edu/vk/) never ceased to provide insightful weather perpectives during my time at the [Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric, and Earth Science](https://earth.miami.edu).
